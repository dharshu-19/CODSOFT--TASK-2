# Personal Portfolio - CodSoft Task 2

In this project, I used HTML and CSS to create a personal portfolio website. I had a great experience working on this task, and the portfolio is designed to be neat and responsive. It is divided into sections such as the header and footer to ensure a clean and organized layout. The Personal Portfolio project is a comprehensive and visually appealing website designed to highlight my skills, projects, and professional background, including sections such as an about me section, skills, projects, testimonials, and a contact form, all styled to create a cohesive and engaging user experience.
